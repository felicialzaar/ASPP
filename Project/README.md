Project description

During a course in computational physics I implemented a number of numerical
methods to e.g. solve differential equations. They are currently only applicable
to to specific problems. In this project, I will generalize them and collect
them in package that I can use in my future work.

The name of this package is now NumMet. It includes modules for numerical
derivation, integration, solving first and second order ODEs and obtaining
Legendre polynomials.
